known BUGS (aka undocumented features ;)
----------------------------------------

* aliases with multiple commands may get wrong completion type
* quote-problems if filename has a real '\' (backslash) in it
   and using single- or double-quotes (backslash-quoting works, though)
* using a slash ('/') in a bookmarks alias name will lead yafc into thinking
   there is a directory to change into
* issuing a "ls /usr /var" gives a listing of both directories mixed together
* issuing a "ls .profile" doesn't list .profile if -a option isn't given
